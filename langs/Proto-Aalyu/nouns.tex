\section{Nouns}
Nouns in \langname are clearly an inflectional category of words, however the degree of morphology attached to nouns is fairly light. All nouns have an implicit animacy that fits into a loose hierarchy which has some minor effects on how nouns may be inflected. As will be seen, this animacy hierarchy has some importance in the verbal morphology as well. Furthermore, third person nouns are marked for obviation for various reasons ranging from sentence level distinctions, to thematic roles, to the general flow of discourse.

\subsection{The Animacy Hierarchy}
\langname displays a three level animacy hierarchy. Though mostly the same throughout, the different levels are treated differently in minor ways through the language, and the animacy system plays a significant role in verbal morphology. The 3 classes distinguish percieved inanimacy, animacy, and sentience, they are listed here with some examples.

      Agentive        & Humans, Spirits, dogs, horses, hawks   \\
      Animate         & Small birds, reptiles, insects, plants \\  % predates domesticated livestock
      Inanimate       & Rocks, water, tools, housing, ideas    \\ \hline

  This table gives a rough illustration of how agency typically functions in \langname. That said, certain things may end up higher or lower depending on general or particular perceptions of agency. For example, if a reptile of some sort is seen as threatening or scheming it may be sporadically elevated to the agentive class. Lowering animacy can happen, but is exceedingly rare. Though one might think it would be useful for a rude insult, that too is very very rare. The culture of insults works rather differently.

\subsection{Common Nominal Particles and Patterns}
There a handful of general use particles and patterns in \langname. With the exception of a couple, they always join at the end on the noun stem, and several may stack on top of each other.

  \subsection{True Plurals}
  Plurals can be denoted on all nouns, but are only mandatory on agentive nouns and personal pronouns. The plural suffixes are \suffixtext{\agtplural}, \suffixtext{\animplural}, and \suffixtext{\inanplural} for the agentive, animate, and inanimate noun classes respectively. For agentive nouns, this surfaces as \suffixtext{\agtvowelplural} after vowels and as \suffixtext{\agtconsplural} after consonants. Some simple examples follow:

  \example{ramaa\agtvowelplural}{spirit.PL}{spirits}

  \subsection{Obviation}
  Obviation is a marking system that is used to distinguish thrid person nouns that might otherwise be confused.  For simple sentences, this allows for clarity in who effects the verb on the other and the degree of volition for lexcially reciprocal verbs. At a discourse level, it keeps competing topics clear. Both agentive and animate verbs share a suffix for indicating the obviative, \suffixtext{\agtobv}, which is \suffixtext{\agtvowelobv} after vowels and \suffixtext{\agtconsobv} after consonants. Inanimate nouns are always marked with \suffixtext{\inanobv}.
  It should be noted, obviation is only marked when the two nouns are of the same animacy or in certain cases where a lower animacy noun exerts on a higher one. In the general case, if two third person nouns of different animacy are present, the higher animacy is assumed to be proximate and the lower obviative.

  \subsection{Possession}
  Possession in \langname is marked via the infix \infixtext{\possessive}. This does not vary based on the animacy of the constituent nouns. This infix is however not used when possessive prouns may fill the role. Furthermore, when two third person nouns, including pronouns, are the constituents of a possessive noun phrase, the possessed noun will always be marked as obviative

  \example{Aamu ini bawa\agtvowelobv}{Mom POSS dog.OBV}{Mom's dog}

  \subsection{Bound Adjectives}
  Most words that map to English adjectives in \langname are verbs. However, a small, calcified group of adjectivals may prefix to nouns. All of these have fully regular verbal equivalents, but it common to use these adjectival prefixes to indicate not only their base meaning, but also frequently extended meanings.
