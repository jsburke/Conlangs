\section{Grammatical Overview}
\langname is a highly synthetic language. The nouns split into one of three classes, are marked for obviation, optionally marked for two kinds of plurality, and can be directly modified in other ways. The verbs inflect for a number of categories. There is a past vs non-past verbal split, a handful of marked aspects, and a large amount of less inflected categories for various subordinating and adverbial usages. The obviate-inverse marking system used in particular ways on both the nouns and verbs largely takes the place of what many would recognize for grammatical voice.
