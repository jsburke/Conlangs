\section{Nominal Suffixes}
\langname used a handful of nominal suffixes to indicate mainly case, and more rarely number and disparagement. Any noun or pronoun could be marked for case. Human nouns and pronouns had mandatory plural marking. And all nouns, but never pronouns, could be marked with a pejorative suffix sort of meaning "crappy" or "stupid".\par

\subsection{The Plural: \texttt{-\plural}}
\langname had a plural marker \texttt{-\plural}; however, despite its wide spread usage in some daughter languages, plural marking was far less common in the past. Scholastic consensus consistently holds that plural marking has always been mandatory for the first and second person pronouns. Third person pronouns, being the same as the demonstrative pronouns, it would have remained mandatory for human references, but for others it seems unlikely given both plural marking in daughter languages and pronominal systems in them. Likewise, nouns that describe humans of any sort had mandatory plural marking. Some animals may have received plural marking, but it is far harder to discern if it was consistent.\par
Plural marking, when used was always most closely bound to the noun, coming before both case or disparagement suffixes.\par

\subsection{The Ergative and Absolutive Cases}
Nouns were marked for the Ergative via the \texttt{-\erg} suffix, while the Absolutive was always left unmarked. In their most plain usage, nouns are unmarked (absolutive case) when they are the subject of intransitive verbs or the object of transitive ones. Ergatives broadly marked subjects of transitive verbs but had further roles enumerated further in examples here.

\subsection{The Genetive: \texttt{-\gen}}
Genetive marking was used to show possesion by one noun over another, or to mark some other close relationship or association or origin.

\subsection{The Dative: \texttt{-\dat}}
Indirect objects, objects of motion or movement, maybe forced possesion. Time to sleep

\subsection{The Oblique: \texttt{-\obl}}
No clue, quirky subjects I guess too
