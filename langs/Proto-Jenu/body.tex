\section{Human Body Terms}
This section provides reconstructions for various \langname anatomical terms. These terms were frequently utilized to describe other things in the language, so we're introducing them early in hopes of easing the reader into a gentler time understanding the language. Of note, \langname seems to have had a weak distinction between the hand-arm and foot-leg pairs, though it is thought terms like palm could be used to clarify hand or foot when needed explicitly; other evidence suggests a 'big'-'little' contrast for arm or leg and hand or foot respectively.
  \subsection{General Body Parts}
  This section will cover general body parts, looking at the whole body. Further sections will focus on terms specific to the face, hand, and others.\par
  \begin{itemize}
    \transitem{Head}{Qhympu}
    \transitem{Neck}{Unle}
    \transitem{Shoulder}{Lekry}
    \transitem{Chest}{Dirwak}
    \transitem{Belly}{Khaama}
    \transitem{Back}{Naga}
    \transitem{Arm / Hand}{Thuu}
    \transitem{Leg / Foot}{Beni}
    \transitem{Knee / Elbow}{Sawak} (\textbf{N.B.:} also seems to mean a \textit{bend, crook} in many cases)
    \transitem{Finger (Toe)}{Zu}
    \transitem{Bum}{Rop}
  \end{itemize}\par
  In the case of \texttt{Zu} meaning \textit{toe} it seems that the term was more specific to fingers, and in context could be \textit{toe}; however, in isolation it is expected that \texttt{Zu Benina}, that is exactly \textit{finger of the foot}.\par
  \subsection{The Face}
  The terms for facial anatomy show some polysemy with non-anatomic elements, but there are not interesting collisions in meaning like seen in the more general anatomy such as 'hand-arm'.\par
  \begin{itemize}
    \transitem{Face}{Hebu}
    \transitem{Ajo}{Eye}
    \transitem{Lyek}{Ear}
    \transitem{Nose}{Nunu}
    \transitem{Mouth}{Nyaam}
    \transitem{Lips}{Marwa}
    \transitem{Chin}{Ipu}
    \transitem{Cheek}{Ek}
    \transitem{Hair}{Xaa}
  \end{itemize}\par
    \subsubsection{Inside the Mouth}
    Cover things like teeth, tongue, etc
    \subsubsection{The Eye in Focus}
    Cover things like white (kaolin), iris, pupil, eyelid...
